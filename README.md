# Python-project3
Excited to share that I've successfully completed my project during my time at CodSoft's internship program for web development! ðŸŽ‰ As part of the project, I created a password generator application using Python with the help of PyCharm. This tool allows users to generate strong and random passwords according to their desired length and complexity.
